# Task-Fragmentation
AN assignment to test the fragmentation ability of Developers

My Pick - Fragment the UI into selective components to make it more readable

## My Reasons for Fragmentating it like that
1) I have break down the large BurnPage component into smaller components, focusing on specific parts of the UI. Eg.,I createed separate components for the burn button bar, burn stats container, transaction table, and chain selector.

2) Each new component will have a clear and specific responsibility, making it easier to understand and maintain. For instance, the burn button bar component will handle the UI elements related to burning tokens, while the burn stats container component will display statistics related to token supply.
